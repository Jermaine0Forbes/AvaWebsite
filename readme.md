### 5/31/20

**Goals for the month**
- ~Add react redux and modify current components~
- ~make "add to cart" button change cart quantity icon~
- create cart list when clicking on cart quantity icon
- Create the "check out" page
- ~create the recent-arrivals page~

**Currently**
- The filter sidebar finally works...for the most part. I'm relieved since it took
me some time to complete so it works. I still need to work on the pagination to see
how it works if there is only 0 results or only 4 pages.
