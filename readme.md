### 3/15/20

**Goals for the month**
- Create login system with oAuth or JWT
- Create/Alter users table that will include permissions and other columns
- Create profile/account  page for user
- create admin page for employees
- generate fake users

**Currently**
- working on login system with JWT and laravel. Almost done, I finally have to make
a request pull info about the user. After that, I will try to implement a google
oAuth in order to pull information by signing into google.
