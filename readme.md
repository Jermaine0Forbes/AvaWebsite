### 8/17/17
-  I was able to add the pictures to the #home-block-1 and it is not more responsive
- #home-block-2 now has pictures within the slick slider, though there are only
two pictures
- I also changed the look of the logo, and made a log specifically for mobile
- The mobile navigation submenu will changed its widht based on the windows width
and it will start from the left.
