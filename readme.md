### 5/5/20

**Goals for the month**
- Add react redux and modify current components
- make "add to cart" button change cart quantity icon
- create cart list when clicking on cart quantity icon
- Create the "check out" page
- create the recent-arrivals page

**Currently**
- The single product page, loads all data that has to deal with the products  and
the fake reviews it receives. Now, I need to include redux in order to store values
all throughout the application.
