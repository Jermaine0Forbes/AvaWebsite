### 5/9/20

**Goals for the month**
- ~Add react redux and modify current components~
- ~make "add to cart" button change cart quantity icon~
- create cart list when clicking on cart quantity icon
- Create the "check out" page
- create the recent-arrivals page

**Currently**
- At this moment, I'm trying to develop the recent-arrivals page  which comes with
with filter sidebar and a possible pagination at the top of the page. This is probably
going to take a long time to develop.
