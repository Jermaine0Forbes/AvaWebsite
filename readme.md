### 5/28/20

**Goals for the month**
- ~Add react redux and modify current components~
- ~make "add to cart" button change cart quantity icon~
- create cart list when clicking on cart quantity icon
- Create the "check out" page
- ~create the recent-arrivals page~

**Currently**
- The pagination works with the recent-arrivals page. There are still a few bugs,
but it generally works. Now, I have to figure out how to integrate the filter sidebar
to make the get requests.
